# SnakeAI
An AI for snake created from scratch. 

This was created before I had learned about machine learning formally, and was scared of backward propogation.
Instead of updating weights with backprop, I instead randomly added some noise to the weights, and chose weights that worked best as a form of "evolution".
For a very naive solution, it worked OK.
However, the code is admittedly horrid now. I keep this as a reminder of where I came from, and to help me reflect how far I've come.
